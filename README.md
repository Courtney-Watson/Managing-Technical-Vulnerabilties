In this lab, I conducted vulnerability assessments using multiple tools to identify and document security risks within a network.
I performed scans with Nmap to detect open ports and services, assessed vulnerabilities using the Greenbone Security Assistant (GVM Framework), and documented findings in SimpleRisk. 
Additionally, I evaluated specific risks such as SMB remote code execution and analyzed the security posture of various hosts, including Windows, Linux, and VMware systems.
